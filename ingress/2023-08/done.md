# Submissions that were included

Quartz64/SOQuartz U-Boot upstreaming work by Kwiboo, write about the new features (load kernel from USB/NVMe, PXE) and future work (hardware RNG for KASLR). Clarify that u-boot itself still needs to be on either SPI/SD/eMMC though. Device trees/configs have been submitted and should land in U-Boot 2023.10. Also note that U-Boot can EFI boot generic aarch64 EFI images, provided their kernels are new enough for device support.
